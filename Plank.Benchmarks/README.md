# Encoding regression suite

`--encoding-regression` measures every encoder path in `Plank.Writing.Encoding` — each supported
(physical type × encoding × repetition) combination, required, optional and repeated — and records a
SHA-256 of each encoded file alongside the timings.

```bash
git checkout master
dotnet run -c Release --project Plank.Benchmarks -- --encoding-regression --label baseline
git checkout my-branch
dotnet run -c Release --project Plank.Benchmarks -- --encoding-regression --label current
dotnet run -c Release --project Plank.Benchmarks -- --encoding-regression-compare \
  artifacts/benchmarks/encoding-regression-baseline.json \
  artifacts/benchmarks/encoding-regression-current.json
```

The compare step exits non-zero when a case flips between `ok` and `failed`, when a case gets slower
than the tolerance, or — most usefully for refactors — when the encoded bytes change at all. A
refactor that is meant to preserve behaviour should report every case as `same`.

**The encoded-bytes check is the exact signal; the timings are a coarse net.** Cases are measured
round-robin (one sample per case per round, 30 rounds) and compared on the fastest observed
iteration, because contention and GC only ever add time. Even so, two *identical* runs on a shared
runner disagree by a median of 2.6% and a p90 of 9%, so the tolerance defaults to 10% and cases whose
baseline is under 100 us are printed but not failed — `bool/plain/required` encodes 200k values in
~30 us, where a few microseconds of jitter reads as tens of percent. Expect the occasional false
positive on a busy machine and re-run before believing a lone timing regression. Tune with
`--tolerance 1.20` and `--significance-floor 500`.

Only `SerializedColumn.Serialize` is timed. That covers level writing, dictionary construction, value
encoding and page splitting, but also the column statistics pass, so encoder-only deltas are damped
rather than shown at full size.

Override the defaults with `--rows` (200,000), `--warmups` (3), `--iterations` (30) or `--output`.

# Published benchmarks

The homepage benchmark is generated manually. DocFX only copies the reviewed JSON snapshot and never runs a benchmark.

Run the small smoke suite first:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project Plank.Benchmarks -- --published-write --quick
```

It covers both suites and every writer, and writes `artifacts/benchmarks/write-quick-v1.json`.

Publish the full 8-warmup, 100-iteration suite:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project Plank.Benchmarks -- --published-write
```

This preloads January 2024 NYC Yellow Taxi data, validates each output separately, and writes the versioned snapshot to `docs/benchmarks/write-v1.json`.

Run the equivalent read suite with:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project Plank.Benchmarks -- --published-read
```

It generates one audited in-memory file per case, then writes `docs/benchmarks/read-v1.json`.
Every timed reader traverses every decoded logical value into a cheap additive checksum. Numeric values
contribute their value, nulls contribute a sentinel, and variable-length values contribute their UTF-8
byte length. The checksum is validated after the timer, so the JIT cannot discard decoded buffers that
a real consumer would observe. Multithreaded readers consume independent columns in parallel and
combine their checksums in schema order.

The checksum is intentionally not collision-resistant and is not a substitute for correctness tests.
It exists only to keep decoded results observable without making a serial hash chain part of the
benchmark. Published read timings generated before this change cannot be compared directly with newer
snapshots.

Use `--data-dir`, `--output`, `--warmups`, `--iterations`, `--workers`, `--synthetic-rows`, or `--synthetic-width` to override the defaults. Pass `--case <id>` to run only the matching case in each suite where that ID exists; filtered runs default to `artifacts/benchmarks/{write,read}-case-v1.json` so they cannot replace a published snapshot.

The Boolean RLE cases cover distinct hybrid-encoding paths: `boolean-rle` retains the alternating,
literal-only input used by the published matrix, `boolean-rle-runs` uses 128-value runs, and
`boolean-rle-mixed` alternates literal regions with long runs.

For a publishable Linux run, reserve one physical core (including its SMT sibling) for the rest of
the machine and run the benchmark on every remaining CPU:

```bash
dotnet build -c Release Plank.Benchmarks/Plank.Benchmarks.csproj
sudo python3 Plank.Benchmarks/scripts/run_cpu_isolated.py -- \
  dotnet Plank.Benchmarks/bin/Release/net10.0/Plank.Benchmarks.dll --published-write
```

The isolation runner snapshots every thread and IRQ affinity before changing anything, restores the
exact masks on normal exit or interruption, and starts a detached watchdog that restores them even if
the runner is killed. It also exports the benchmark CPU list to the child. Plank uses its
`OnWorkerStarted` hook to bind each benchmark worker to a distinct logical CPU; libraries without a
per-worker hook remain confined to the same benchmark-only CPU set.

## One snapshot per CPU

A run measures one machine. Publishing a single machine's numbers hides the cases where the ranking
depends on the hardware — vector width, core count and memory bandwidth all move the results, and a
24-thread desktop says nothing about how the multithreaded rows behave on 8 cores. So the homepage
carries one snapshot pair per CPU and lets the reader pick.

Run both suites on each machine, collect the six files, then publish them together:

```bash
python3 Plank.Benchmarks/scripts/publish_matrix.py \
  --machine "ryzen-9-7900x:AMD Ryzen 9 7900X:desktop-write.json:desktop-read.json" \
  --machine "xeon-e3-1230-v6:Intel Xeon E3-1230 v6:server-a-write.json:server-a-read.json" \
  --default ryzen-9-7900x
```

That copies each pair to `docs/benchmarks/{write,read}-<id>-v1.json` and writes the
`docs/benchmarks/machines-v1.json` index the page reads. It refuses a machine whose write and read
halves came from different commits or different CPUs, and warns when the machines are not all at the
same commit — either one makes the matrix compare things that were never comparable.

Without the isolation runner, **idle the machine first.** Stop anything else that runs on it, including
the fuzz fleet (`pkill -9 -f afl-fuzz`), and check with `ps -eo pcpu,args --sort=-pcpu | head`. A
background service taking a few cores does not show up as high in-run variation; it just makes that
CPU look slow.

## How much these numbers move

Intra-run `variationPercent` understates reproducibility, because it only sees jitter within one run.
Across separate runs on the same idle machine and the same commit, read cases drift by a median of
1.5%, but write cases drift 12–30%. The suite uses eight warmups because two warmups left tiered-JIT
transitions inside the measured samples: for example, real-world nullable timestamps on Ryzen moved
from 31–99 ms during compilation to 10–11 ms at steady state. Treat a single write row moving by less
than ~30% as noise, and re-run before believing it.
